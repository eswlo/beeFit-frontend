# beeFit
beeFit is a full-stack, fitness tracking, and loyalty program Android app that aims to enhance omnichannel integration and encourage users to stay healthy.

## About
Users can earn points by achieving their fitness goals, and redeem rewards using the earned points to—hypothetically—shop with the retail stores that the app partners with.

Please be advised that the brands and stores used in this app are for demonstration purposes only.

## Getting Started
The following introduces how to set up the backend and frontend to run the app locally. 

### Setting up backend
- Clone [beeFit-backend](https://github.com/eswlo/beeFit-backend).
- <a href="https://github.com/eswlo/beeFit-backend" target="_blank">beeFit-backend</a>
- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) if needed.
- Set up [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) and have the connection string ready.
- Open the cloned folder in your chosen IDE and execute `npm install` in the terminal to install necessary dependencies:
- Create a `.env file` in the folder, and add the following code into the file after replacing `CS` with your MongoDB connection string:
```
MONGODB_URI="CS"
```
- Execute `npm run dev` in the terminal to connect to MongoDB.
